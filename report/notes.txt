- Search for a node with minimal "open space" - space on top that needs to be filled
- starting height = 0
- Cost is filled by height cost of node

- For each node visible from top, cost = (height): minimize the cost

Target: Find node with cost = min
- increase min cost until node found.

- Cost so far: current cost + heuristic of cost removed
